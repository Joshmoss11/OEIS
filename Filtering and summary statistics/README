==========
getConverges.m - checks whether sequences converges. A sequence if the derivatives on the last 10 numbers get smaller. 
We caculate the derivatives on the absolute value of the integers

getDifferences.m - finds the median of differences between adjacent members in a sequence for each sequence

getLengths.m - gets lengths of each sequence

getPercentageCubed.m - finds percentage of numbers that are cubed in each sequence negative numbers are not seen as cubed numbers

getPercentageSquared.m - finds percentage of numbers that are cubed in each sequence negative numbers are not seen as squared numbers

getPrimesPercent.m - finds percentage of primes. s4 contains all numbers that are prime in cleaned_data.mat. negative numbers are not considered prime

getMedianModulo.m finds modulo of first 10 primes for each number in sequence 
Computes median for each number and then for each sequence for on aforementioned median
displays the medians that are negative as their absolute value so that they can be displayed in log scale
This is done on the OESI cleaned data set(cleaned.mat) and random datasets from the normal and uniform distribution.

figures - folder contains all figure created by above scripts/functions

cleaned_data.mat - sequences after filtering and cleaning

s4.mat - all prime numbers that exist in cleaned_data.mat
