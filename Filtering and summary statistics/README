getConverges.m - checks whether sequences converges. A sequence is defines as converging if the last 10 members in the sequence fulfill the ratio test conditions

getDifferences.m - finds the median of differences between adjacent members in a sequence for each sequence

getLengths.m - gets lengths of each sequence

getPercentageCubed.m - finds percentage of numbers that are cubed in each sequence negative numbers are not seen as cubed numbers

getPercentageSquared.m - finds percentage of numbers that are cubed in each sequence negative numbers are not seen as squared numbers

getPrimesPercent.m - finds percentage of primes. s4 contains all numbers that are prime in cleaned_data.mat. negative numbers are not considered prime

getMedianModulo.m finds modulo of first 10 primes for each number in sequence.
Computes median for each number and then for each seqience for on aforementioned median

figures - folder contains all figure created by above scripts/functions

cleaned_data.mat - sequences after filtering and cleaning

s4.mat - all prime numbers that exist in cleaned_data.mat
